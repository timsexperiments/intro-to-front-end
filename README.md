# Introduction to Front End Engineering

Welcome! This repository serves as the interactive textbook and syllabus for your journey from Visual Designer to Full-Stack Software Engineer.

We take a unique approach: starting with the **Visual** (what you can see), diving into the **Network** (how it travels), solidifying the **Logic** (how it works), and finally building the **Infrastructure** (where it lives).

## Repository Structure

The course is organized into **Modules**. Each module acts as a chapter, and each submodule is a specific lesson.

## How This Works

1.  **Navigate to a Module:**
    Start by opening the `README.md` inside `modules/01_front_end_foundations`. This will outline the software you need (e.g., VS Code, Node.js) and the learning goals for that section.

2.  **Read the Lesson:**
    Go into a submodule (e.g., `01_the_dom`) and read the `README.md`. This contains the theory, diagrams, and code examples.

3.  **Complete the Assignment:**
    Open `assignment.md` in the same folder.

    - **Do not** submit code to this repository.
    - You should create a separate folder on your computer (e.g., `~/course-work`) or a personal GitHub repository to keep your projects organized.
    - Follow the instructions to build the project locally.

## Prerequisites

There are no global prerequisites for this entire course other than git and a computer with an internet connection.

To install git on your computer, visit [here](https://git-scm.com/).

**Each Module has its own specific requirements.**

- _Example:_ Module X only requires a Web Browser. **We strongly recommend Google Chrome for its superior Developer Tools.**
- _Example:_ Module X will require installing Node.js and a text editor (e.g., Neovim, VS Code, etc...).

Please check the `README.md` inside each Module folder before starting the lessons.
