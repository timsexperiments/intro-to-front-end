# Introduction to Front End Engineering

This repository hosts the source code for the inclusive, interactive curriculum: **Introduction to Front End Engineering**.

It is designed to take students on a journey from "Visual Designer" to "Full-Stack Software Engineer," emphasizing first principles over fleeting frameworks.

## Curriculum

The course is structured into 7 core modules, moving from the visual layer down to the metal, and back up to modern architecture.
