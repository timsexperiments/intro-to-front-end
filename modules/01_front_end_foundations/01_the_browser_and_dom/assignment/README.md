# Assignment: The Inspector

Before we build, we hack.

## Goal

Understand that the web is just a mutable tree of objects.

## Instructions

1.  Open [Google.com](https://www.google.com) (or any simple site) in Chrome.
2.  Right-click the "Google Search" button and select **Inspect**.
3.  In the **Elements** panel, find the text inside the button.
4.  Double-click the text and change it to "DO NOT CLICK".
5.  Find the Google Logo `<img>` tag. Press `Delete` on your keyboard to remove it.
6.  Take a look around the elements panel and wreak havoc on the page :).
