# Assignment: The Interaction

Finally, let's bring the card to life.

## Instructions

Update your `app.js` to handle the "Follow" button click.

1.  **Select**: Use `document.querySelector` to grab the Button and the "Role" text element.
2.  **Listen**: Add a `click` event listener to the button.
3.  **React**: Inside the event function:
    - Change the button text to "Following".
    - Change the button background color (e.g., add a class `.following` defined in your CSS).
    - Log "User followed!" to the console.

## Bonus Challenge

Make it a toggle! If I click it again, it should go back to "Follow".
_Hint: Check the current text or class to decide what to do._

## Deliverable

A fully interactive Profile Card. Clicking the button updates the UI instantly without reloading the page.
