# Assignment: The Skeleton

We are starting our iterative project: **The User Profile Card**.
In this step, we build the raw HTML structure.

## Setup

1.  Create a folder named `profile-card-project`.
2.  Inside it, create a file named `index.html`.

## Instructions

Write the HTML for a profile card. It must include:

1.  **Container**: A `<div>` or `<article>` to hold the card.
2.  **Image**: An `<img>` for the profile picture (use a placeholder like `https://i.pravatar.cc/300`).
3.  **Name**: An `<h1>` or `<h2>` with your name.
4.  **Role**: A `<p>` or `<h3>` with your job title (e.g., "Frontend Student").
5.  **Details**: A list (`<ul>`) of 3 skills (e.g., "Design", "HTML", "Figma").
6.  **Action**: A `<button>` that says "Follow".

## Constraint

**Do not add any CSS yet.** It should look ugly. That is expected.

## Deliverable

Open `index.html` in Chrome. It should show your content in a vertical list with Times New Roman font.
