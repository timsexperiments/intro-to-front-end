# Assignment: The Logic

Before we touch the DOM, let's write some pure JavaScript to understand the syntax.

## Setup

1.  Continue in your `profile-card-project` folder.
2.  Create a file named `app.js`.
3.  Link it in your HTML `<body>` (right before the closing tag):
    ```html
    <script src="app.js"></script>
    ```

## Instructions

Open `app.js` and write code to do the following:

1.  **Variables**: Create a `const` variable for your name and a `let` variable for your age.
2.  **Function**: Write a function named `isAdult` that takes an age as an argument.
    - If age is >= 18, return `true`.
    - Else, return `false`.
3.  **Log**: `console.log` a message using these variables, e.g., "Tim is an adult: true".

## Deliverable

Open your `index.html` in Chrome. Open the **Console** (Right-click -> Inspect -> Console tab). You should see your message printed there.
