# Assignment: The Skeleton

We are starting our iterative project: **The User Profile Card**.

In this step, we will ignore colors, fonts, and layout. We will focus purely on the **Structure**. A blind user reading your site should understand exactly what the content is based on the tags you choose.

## Setup

1.  Create a folder named `profile-card-project` inside your course repository.
2.  Inside it, create a file named `index.html`.

## Instructions

Write the HTML for a profile card. It must include:

1.  **Container**: Use an `<article>` tag to hold the card content.
2.  **Image**: An `<img>` for the profile picture (use a placeholder like `https://i.pravatar.cc/300`).
    - _Requirement:_ You must include a descriptive `alt` attribute.
3.  **Name**: An `<h1>` or `<h2>` heading.
4.  **Role**: An appropriate heading level (lower than the name) or a paragraph.
5.  **Details**: An unordered list (`<ul>`) of 3 skills (e.g., "Design", "HTML", "Figma").
6.  **Bio**: A short description using `<p>`.
7.  **Action**: A link `<a>` that acts as a button saying "Contact Me".
    - Set the `href` to `mailto:your-email@example.com` (this opens the user's email app).
8.  **Footer**: A `<footer>` element containing a copyright notice (e.g., "&copy; 2024").

## Documentation & Reflection

As an engineer, writing code is only half the job. Documenting your decisions is the other half.

For this assignment, you will create a `README.md` file in your project folder to answer a few questions.

### What is Markdown?

You are currently reading a Markdown file! Markdown (`.md`) is a lightweight language used to format text. It is standard in the software industry for documentation.

It is conceptually very similar to HTML, but simplified:

| HTML                     | Markdown      | Description   |
| :----------------------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| `<h1>Title</h1>`         | `# Title`     | Main Heading  |
| `<h2>Subtitle</h2>`      | `## Subtitle` | Sub-heading   |
| `<p>Text</p>`            | `Text`        | Standard text |
| `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` | `- Item`      | Bullet list   |
| `<code>Code</code>`      | `` `Code` ``  | Inline code   |

### The Reflection Task

Create a file named `README.md` inside your `profile-card-project` folder. Copy the questions below and answer them using Markdown syntax:

```markdown
# Module 2 Reflection

1. Why did you choose to use an `<article>` tag for the card instead of a `<div>`?

2. A screen reader user lands on your page and wants to skip straight to the main content. Which specific HTML tag in your code helps them match that intent?

3. What happens if you remove the `alt` attribute from your image? Who specifically does this affect, and how?

4. You are building a blog. You want the main logo to click through to the home page.
   - Option A: `<img src="logo.png" onclick="goToHome()">`
   - Option B: `<a href="/"><img src="logo.png"></a>`
   - **Question**: Which option is better and exactly why?
```

## Constraint

**Do not add any CSS yet.**
It will look "ugly" (Times New Roman, vertical stacking). This is expected. We are building the skeleton; we will add the skin in the next module.

## Deliverable: Source Control

Now that we have written code, we need to save it to the cloud. You will simulate a professional workflow using **Branches** and **Pull Requests**.

### 1. The Branch (The Sandbox)

We rarely push directly to the `main` branch. Instead, we create a "Feature Branch" to work safely.

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for the entire module
# (Note: 'switch -c' creates a new branch, similar to the older 'checkout -b')
git switch -c module-01-foundations
```

### 2. The Commit (The Save Point)

We will commit our changes. **Pay close attention to the naming convention.**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "02 HTML (The Structure)"
```

_Note: For this course, always name the commit after the Submodule you just finished._

### 3. The Push (The Cloud)

Send your branch to GitHub (or GitLab).

```bash
git push -u origin module-01-foundations
```

### 4. The Pull Request (The Review)

A **Pull Request (PR)** (called a **Merge Request** in GitLab) is a request to merge your branch into the main codebase. It creates a space for code review.

**Option A: The GitHub CLI (Recommended)**
If you have the `gh` tool installed ([Download here](https://cli.github.com/)):

```bash
gh pr create --title "Module 01: Front End Foundations" --body "Completed HTML structure."
```

**Option B: The Web UI**

1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.com.
2.  You should see a banner saying "module-01-foundations had recent pushes."
3.  Click **Compare & pull request**.
4.  Set the title to **"Module 01: Front End Foundations"**.
5.  Click **Create Pull Request**.

### Important Note

**Do not merge this PR yet!**
We will continue working on this same branch (`module-01-foundations`) for the CSS and JavaScript assignments. You will stack those commits onto this same Pull Request.
